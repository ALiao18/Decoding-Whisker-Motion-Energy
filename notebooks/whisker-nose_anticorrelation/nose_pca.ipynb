PC1’s sign is fixed so the X-loading ≥ 0, making it deterministic across sessions. We store the PC1 score (nose_pc1) and report the % variance explained by PC1.\n","\n","2. **Wheel (position & velocity):** Wheel is sampled on its native (irregular) timestamps; velocity is the time-derivative on that native clock. To align with camera frames without interpolation, we use a causal hold-last-sample (backward-asof) join and record the age of the matched wheel sample (wheel_age_s). We then mask wheel_pos/vel when stale using a data-driven threshold max_age = min(max(3×p95_age, p99_age), 0.5s). This preserves temporal integrity (no future peeking), avoids blending, and cleanly flags gaps.\n","\n","3. **Signals & clock:** All columns live on the session master clock; pose and whisker motion energy (whiskerME) are frame-aligned to camera times; wheel fields are attached per the rule above.
